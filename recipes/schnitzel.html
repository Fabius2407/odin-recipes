    <h2>A good old german schnitzel</h2>
    <p>Translation of the name: 'Wiener' this word comes from the word 'Wien', 
        which is the Austrian city called Vienna. 
        'Schnitzel' means basically meat in a crust. 
        I'm German and hope you can understand my English description. 
        Serve the schnitzels with salad, ketchup and French fries.
